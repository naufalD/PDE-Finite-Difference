## Introduction
The finite difference method is used to solve partial diffeerential equations. In this case, we consider the finding the electric potential between charged plates by numerically solving Poisson's equation. This is part of exercise 17.4 in the computational physics textbook by Landau (2015)[^1] on PDEs.
